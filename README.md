## About

The first unit demonstrates using HTML and CSS to make a simple web site.

The HTML and CSS code must pass W3C validation and images must be resized so the profile image is
under 400kb and the background image is under 1mb.

## Usage

You can view hosted site [here](https://adamelliotfields.github.io/treehouse-profile-page).

You can also simply open `index.html` in your browser directly. For example, if your macOS user name
is `adam` and you cloned the repo in `~/Downloads`, then go to
<file:///Users/adam/Downloads/treehouse-profile-page/index.html> in your web browser.

You can also use PHP or Python's built-in HTTP server by running one of these commands in the same
directory as `index.html`.

```bash
# PHP
php -S localhost:8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# Python 3
python3 -m http.server
```

## Validating HTML and CSS

Use the [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and
[W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) validators by pasting the code
into the text input.

## Browser Compatibility

The CSS has been vendor prefixed using [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io) using the
[defaults](https://browsersl.ist/?q=defaults) browsers list.
